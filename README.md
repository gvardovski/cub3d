🧠 Cub3D is a small educational project designed to help you dive into the world of computer graphics and systems programming! 🚀
Built entirely in C, it challenges you to implement a simple 3D engine using the classic ray-casting technique 🔦 — the same concept that powered early 3D games like Wolfenstein 3D. 🎮
Perfect for learning how rendering works under the hood, managing performance, and bringing a flat 2D map to life in 3D! 🌍✨
